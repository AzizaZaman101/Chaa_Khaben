                        <p class="description-news">Long before banknotes, China was out here paying salaries in tea—yep, actual tea bricks! Back in the Tang Dynasty, tea was so valuable it bought you horses, silk, and probably some serious bragging rights.

In Bangladesh, tea is practically a national fuel—found in villages, cities, and every cha-er dokan (tea stall) in between. Whether you like it black, milky, or spiced, tea is the real MVP, turning strangers into friends one sip at a time!</p>

Sylhet and Srimangal teas are packed with flavor, color, and enough caffeine to make coffee jealous. Add condensed milk and sugar, and you’ve got a drink so thick and rich, it should probably be taxed!</p>
