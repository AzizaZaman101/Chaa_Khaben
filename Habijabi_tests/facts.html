                        <p class="description-news">In ancient China, tea was so valuable that it was used as currency. During the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), compressed tea bricks were used for trade and tax payments. These tea bricks were especially popular in Tibet, Mongolia, and Central Asia, where they were exchanged for horses, silk, and other goods. Even soldiers were sometimes paid in tea instead of money. The practice lasted for centuries until loose-leaf tea became more common. Today, while tea is no longer a form of currency, its economic and cultural value remains strong worldwide.</p>

                        <br>
                       
                        <p class="description-news">In Bangladesh, tea is more than just a drink—it’s a way of life. Many Bangladeshis consume more tea than water daily, making it a central part of their routine. Whether in a village, a city café, or a roadside tea stall (cha-er dokan), tea is always available. The most common tea in Bangladesh is black tea with milk and sugar, but herbal and spiced varieties are also gaining popularity. Tea stalls serve as social hubs, where people gather to chat, debate, or just relax. This deep connection to tea makes Bangladesh one of the most tea-loving nations in the world.</p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <p class="description-news">When the British first started importing tea from China in the 17th century, they treated it as a highly guarded secret. At first, tea was considered a luxury product, only affordable to the wealthy. To maintain their monopoly, the British did not reveal how tea was cultivated. However, in the 19th century, a Scottish botanist named Robert Fortune disguised himself as a Chinese merchant and smuggled tea plants and seeds to India. This act led to the establishment of mass tea plantations in India and later Bangladesh, changing the global tea industry forever.</p>
